# Go Spock Yourself

"Go spock yourself" is a game for everyone who wants to have fun and laugh together. It's a completley luck-based game where the computer randomly selects its move against you.

The game is popular and often used to decide who starts a match, kicks of a game or settles a dispute. It began with the classic rock, paper, scissors, but has since evovled into an expanded version including lizard and spock. This expansion increases the number of possible outcomes and reduces the change of a tie, making the game more strategic and unpredictable.

The rules of "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" are as follows:

- Scissors cuts paper, decapitates lizard.
- Paper covers rock, disproves spock.
- Rock crushes scissors, crushes lizard.
- Lizaed poisons spock, eats paper.
- Spock smashes scissors, vaporizes rock.
